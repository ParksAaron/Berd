# Product requirements document (PRD)

### What is Your App Vision Statement?
> Berd will be a social media mobile application, where users who are 21+ can review beers, check in at breweries, and follow other users to see their activity. There are other beer review websites and apps that are similar, but their styling and user experiences are dated, Berd is the new and modern app that the craft beer community needs.
